This repository contains the materials submitted for the Getting and Cleaning Data course project, course getdata-030. The R code script to perform the analysis is in the run_analysis.R file, and supporting functions to convert feature names to user-friendly, self descriptive names is in prettyNames.R, upon which run_analysis.R depends.

The README.md (and its sources, GCDReadme.rmd and GCDReadme.md) file provides contains the markdown source for the project readme file, and the GCDReadme.html holds the generated output. The README.md documents the processing steps applied to the raw data to obtain the tidy data deliverable for the project. Similarly, the code book for this project is in R-markdown format as GCDCodeBook.rmd, and the "knitted" output is in GCDCodeBook.html. To comply with project specifications, the CodeBook.md file is provided. The code book documents the variables (columns) of the resulting tidy data set.

The Getting and Cleaning data deliverable content in this repository should be considered to be the current README.txt, the README.md and CodeBook.md descriptive files and the run_analysis.R and prettyNames.R script files.
