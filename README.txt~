This repository contains the materials submitted for the Getting and Cleaning Data course project, course getdasta-030. The R codescript to perform the analysis is in the run_analysis.R file, and a supporting function to convert feature names to user-friendly, self descriptive names is in prettyNames.R, upon which run_analysis.R depends.

The GCDReadme.rmd file provides contains the R-markdown source for the project readme file, and the GCDReadme.html holds the generated output. The GCDReadme documents the processing steps applied to the raw data to obtain the tidy data deliverable for the project. Similarly, the code book for this project is in R-markdown format as GCDCodeBook.rmd, and the "knitted" output is in GCDCodeBook.html. The code book documents the variables (columns) of the resulting tidy data set.
